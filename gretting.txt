Hello there! I&apos;m Jo√£o Pedro (JP), a passionate fullstack
software developer with a journey spanning over 6 exciting months in
the world of code. My fascination with technology led me to dive
into various aspects of web development, and I&apos;ve had the
pleasure of working with a range of technologies including Node.js,
React, and Spring Boot. I enjoy crafting dynamic and intuitive
digital experiences. From server-side logic to polished user
interfaces, I take pride in my ability to traverse the full
development spectrum. Let&apos;s connect and create something
remarkable together!
